It is important to choose a license because these licenses ensure that the project that the license is used on can be freely used and modified. They also make sure the project conforms to other norms and expectations.  

# 2
If you use an open-source project that is not properly licensed, then everyone who contributes to that project becomes the copyright holder of that work. That means this work will not be considered open source and may not be freely used.  

# 3
I agree with the claim that the use of open-source allowed the web to beat out Gopher. With more people working and looking at more upgrades and fixes were made to the web. Also since people are able to review the code used for the web, custom applications can be created in more suitable ways.  

# 4
Android uses Apache 2.0 instead of LGPL. Although Android encourages developers to make their software and hardware modifiable but does not want to force developers to do so. This is why Apache is used instead of LGPL. LGPL is more restrictive in areas such as shipping source code with the application and requiring the allowance for customer modification. If all developers were forced to do this, some developers may decide not to produce Android applications.
